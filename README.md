# gif-loader
Simple project for loading gifs from multiple resources (giphy and pixabay).

You asked me about a simple node server but during recruitment call I heard all of you work as a fullstack so I decided to create the server in TypeScript / Express.js.
Frontend is written in React / Sass.

#Run server
Directly in server directory, install dependencies by

`npm install` 

and after this
 
 `npm start`
 
#Run app
Directly in app directory, install dependencies by

`npm install`

and after this

`npm start`
